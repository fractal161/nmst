# nestris-match-stats-tools

A library of utility functions to interface with the [CTM Masters Match Statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1okxWvivh0jxl6FgCItqwQPflL0QiW1yY2bMWWBHlClo/edit#gid=273282169) dataset maintained by aGameScout, Marfram, and Hydrantdude. Examples of the library in action can be found in the aptly named `examples/` directory, which implements common tables found on the spreadsheet itself. Each example is heavily commented, with the intent of demonstrating common patterns and the logic behind them.

Small warning: this is a new project, so much is subject to change.

## Setup

Since this is a python project, the first thing you'll need is a working installation of [python](https://www.python.org/). All testing has been done on version 3.10, but any 3.x version should work as well (if not, please raise and issue [here](https://github.com/fractal161/nmst/issues)!).

After this, you'll need the following libraries:

 - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a data analysis library providing several data access patterns. Almost all operations with nmst are carried out with pandas [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe).
 - [numpy](https://numpy.org/), used by pandas for lower-level array manipulation. It can provide better performance in certain cases
 - [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/), which renders HTML in a GUI window and is used for displaying DataFrames as tables.

There are many ways to go about this; perhaps the simplest is to use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/) with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Finally, customization for how the library behaves is handled by a `config.toml` file. We provide a template file named `config.toml.example` which provides descriptions for each option, along with a default value. *Do not edit this file*: instead, copy it into `config.toml` and change that[^1].

After that, you're all set! Head over to the `examples/` directory for guidance on how to get started, or start a shell in the root directory and proceed with the data-crunching.

[^1] This will automatically be done upon the first usage of the library.
